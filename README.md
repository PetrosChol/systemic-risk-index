An interactive dashboard to monitor systemic risk in financial markets using a custom-built index and Generative AI-powered analysis.

## 🚀 Features

-   **Dynamic Systemic Risk Index (SRI):** A proprietary index constructed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on key risk indicators, scaled historically for context.
-   **Interactive Dashboard:** A fluid Streamlit application for visualizing the SRI and its underlying components over time.
-   **Generative AI Summaries:** On-demand economic outlooks generated by leading AI models (from Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Groq).
-   **Automated Data Pipeline:** Fetches and preprocesses the latest data from FRED and Yahoo Finance with a single click.

## 🛠️ How It Works

The core of this project is the **Systemic Risk Index (SRI)**, which provides a historical measure of financial market stress.

1.  **Data Collection:** Key financial stress indicators are collected:
   -   `VIX`: Equity Market Volatility
   -   `MOVE`: Treasury Bond Market Volatility
   -   `BAMLC0A0CMEY`: US Corporate Bond Yield (Credit Risk)
2.  **Data Standardization:** The indicators are standardized to ensure each contributes equally to the analysis.
3.  **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** PCA is applied to identify the primary axis of shared variance among the indicators.
4.  **Index Construction:** The first principal component (PC1) is extracted, representing the most significant combined movement of the risk factors.
5.  **Historical Scaling:** The final index is scaled from 0-100 over the **entire historical dataset**. This ensures that today's SRI value is directly comparable to risk levels during major past events like the 2008 crisis or the 2020 pandemic.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.12+
-   `uv` - A high-performance Python package installer and resolver.
    -   If you don't have it: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PetrosChol/systemic-risk-index.git
    cd systemic-risk-index
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies using `uv`:**
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    This project requires an API key from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED).
    Also requires an OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini or Groq API key for Generative AI model access.
    -   Sign up for a free API key at [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/).
    -   Sign up for an API key at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
    -   Sign up for an API key at [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys).
    -   Sign up for an API key at [Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
    -   Sign up for a free API key at [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys).

    -   Rename the file named `.env.example` in the project's root directory to `.env`.
    -   Add your FRED API key to this file:
        ```env
        # .env
        FRED_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
    It is not necessary to set all keys, you can use only the ones you need. Fred is required, the others are optional.

### Running the Application

1.  **Launch the Streamlit dashboard:**
    ```bash
    uv run streamlit run .\gen_ai\app.py
    ```

2.  **Download the data:**
    -   Upon first launch, the app will prompt you that data is missing.
    -   Use the **"Download Fresh Risk Data"** button in the sidebar to automatically fetch, process, and save the necessary data.

3.  **Start Analyzing!**
    -   View the Systemic Risk Index and its components.
    -   Select a Generative AI model from the sidebar and click "Generate Summary" to get an AI-powered analysis.
